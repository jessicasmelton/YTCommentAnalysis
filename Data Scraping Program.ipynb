        "This program is designed to fetch details and comments from a specific YouTube video using the YouTube Data API. It retrieves video metadata, including the title, channel details, view count, and upload date, as well as all comments and their replies. The comments are saved into a CSV file named after the video title.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Usage:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Obtain a YouTube Data API Key:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Go to the Google Developers Console.\n",
        "*   Create a new project or select an existing one.\n",
        "*   Enable the YouTube Data API v3.\n",
        "*   Create an API key and copy it.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Set the API Key:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Replace the DEVELOPER_KEY value in the code with your API key.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Run the Program:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Ensure you have the correct video ID for the YouTube video you want to analyze.\n",
        "*   Replace the video_id variable value with your desired video ID.\n",
        "*   Run the program\n",
        "*   The program will fetch video details and comments, and save the comments to a CSV file named after the video title.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Notes:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The YouTube Data API has usage quotas and rate limits. Ensure your usage complies with these limits to avoid service interruptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The program currently fetches comments in batches of 100. Modify the maxResults parameter if you need to adjust the number of comments fetched per request.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Potential Errors and Fixes:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. API Key Errors - If you encounter an error related to the API key, ensure that it is correctly copied and that the YouTube Data API v3 is enabled in your Google Developers Console.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Data Handling - If there are issues with saving the CSV file, ensure the video title does not contain special characters that are not allowed in file names.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Rate Limits - If you exceed the API rate limit, you might need to wait before making additional requests or consider optimizing the number of requests made."
